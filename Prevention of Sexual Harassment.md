# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

### What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment can include unwanted touching, staring, or comments about someone’s body or appearance. It also happens when someone makes inappropriate jokes, sends offensive messages, or pressures others for dates or favors. It’s not limited to physical acts — even suggestive looks, gestures, or sharing explicit content can create a hostile environment. Essentially, any behavior that makes a person feel uncomfortable, threatened, or disrespected because of their gender or sexuality is harassment.

### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If I face or see sexual harassment, I’d first ensure my safety and stay calm. It’s important to clearly tell the person that their behavior is not okay if I feel safe doing so. I would document what happened — times, places, people involved — to have a record. Then, I’d report the incident to the designated person or committee at work, like the PoSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment) committee. If the issue continues, I would follow up with HR or seek advice on further steps. Above all, I would support anyone else affected and ensure these matters are treated seriously — because silence can enable the problem to continue.
