# **Listening and Active Communication**

## **Question 1: What are the steps/strategies to do Active Listening?** 

- Pay full attention to the speaker without distractions.  
- Show that you are listening through body language like nodding and eye contact.  
- Don’t interrupt; wait for the speaker to finish before responding.  
- Reflect back by summarizing or paraphrasing what the speaker said to confirm understanding.  
- Ask clarifying questions if something is unclear.  
- Avoid judging or jumping to conclusions; be open-minded to their message.  

## **Question 2: According to Fisher's model, what are the key points of Reflective Listening?**

Fisher’s model says reflective listening means really understanding what the other person is saying by repeating or summarizing their words and feelings. It also means paying attention to their body language and emotions. This helps make sure you got their message right and shows the speaker that you care and are listening well.

## **Question 3: What are the obstacles in your listening process?**

Sometimes I get distracted by noises or my own thoughts, which makes it hard to focus. At times, I might anticipate what the person will say next and miss their full message. Also, if the topic is boring or complicated, I tend to lose interest or get confused easily.

## **Question 4: What can you do to improve your listening?**

I can try to remove distractions like my phone or background noise when someone is talking. Practicing mindfulness to stay present helps me focus more on the speaker. Also, I can ask questions and repeat what I heard to make sure I understood correctly. Taking notes sometimes also helps to keep track of important points.

## **Question 5: When do you switch to Passive communication style in your day to day life?**

I tend to be passive when I feel unsure about speaking up or when I want to avoid conflict. Sometimes, if I am tired or worried about how my opinion might be received, I just keep quiet and go along with what others say.

## **Question 6: When do you switch into Aggressive communication styles in your day to day life?**

I notice I become aggressive when I feel very frustrated or when I think people are not listening to me. If I feel pressured or unfairly treated, I sometimes respond with sharp words or try to take control of the conversation.

## **Question 7: When do you switch into Passive Aggressive (sarcasm/gossiping/taunts/silent treatment and others) communication styles in your day to day life?**

I might act passive aggressive when I’m upset but don’t want to openly say it. Instead, I use sarcasm or stay silent to express my feelings indirectly. This usually happens when I am afraid of direct confrontation or when I feel misunderstood.

## **Question 8: How can you make your communication assertive?** 

To make my communication assertive, I can practice expressing my thoughts and feelings clearly and respectfully, without being passive or aggressive. It helps to focus on the issue, not the person, and to use “I” statements that show ownership of my feelings. Staying calm and composed, even if the conversation gets challenging, lets me maintain control. I can also prepare in advance what I want to say to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Lastly, being open to feedback and willing to find a middle ground encourages positive and effective communication.
