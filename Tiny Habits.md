# Tiny Habits

### Question 1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?  
What really caught my attention was how BJ Fogg said you can start a habit with something ridiculously small, like flossing just one tooth. It made me realize I don’t have to overhaul my whole routine all at once. Starting tiny feels less intimidating and actually doable.

### Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?  
B = MAP stands for Behavior (Motivation Ability Prompt). To make a habit stick:  
- **Motivation (M):** Find a reason that genuinely excites or matters to me.  
- **Ability (A):** Keep the habit simple so it’s easy to do right now.  
- **Prompt (P):** Have something that reminds me to do it, like a visual cue or a specific time of day.  
This formula makes habits feel less like chores and more like natural parts of daily life.

### Question 3: Why is it important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit?  
Celebration is like telling my brain, “Hey, you did something good!” That little moment of joy or pride makes me want to do it again. It’s funny how a simple smile or fist pump can turn a small action into a lasting habit.

### Question 4: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?  
The idea that getting just 1% better every day adds up to massive growth really stuck with me. It’s encouraging because it means huge changes don’t happen overnight—they come from consistent small wins, which feels way more achievable.

### Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?  
The book argues that real change happens when you reshape who you believe you are—your identity—not just your behaviors. When I think “I’m a reader” instead of “I should read,” reading becomes part of who I am, not just what I do.

### Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?  
Making a habit easier means removing obstacles. Like if I want to exercise, laying out my gear the night before reduces friction. Breaking habits into tiny, manageable actions helps me start without overthinking or procrastinating.

### Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?  
To stop bad habits, the book suggests making them harder or less convenient. For example, deleting distracting apps or not keeping junk food around makes it less likely I’ll give in. Increasing the effort creates natural barriers.

### Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?  
I want to read more regularly. To nudge myself, I’ll put the book right on my desk so I can’t miss it (the cue). I’ll pick books I actually find interesting to make reading fun (attractive). Starting with just a page or two makes it easy, and after finishing, I’ll treat myself with a small break or coffee (satisfying).

### Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?  
I want to cut down on mindless social media scrolling. Turning off notifications makes the cue disappear. Moving apps to a less accessible folder on my phone adds friction. I’ll replace that time with a quick walk or stretching to put a positive spin on breaking the habit.
