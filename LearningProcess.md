# Learning Reflection

### 2. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?  
The most interesting idea for me was asking the experts how they learn a topic. Sometimes you get to know a better approach to learning new things, and sometimes you see that you are already doing what an expert does to understand. This gives you more confidence in your own way of learning.

### 3. What are active and diffused modes of thinking?  
- **Active mode**: When you are completely focused on something and thinking only about that thing.  
- **Diffused mode**: When you are not actively thinking about a topic, but you stay relaxed and allow new ideas to come to your mind.

### 4. According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic?  
- Break the topic into small parts and find which ones are most important.  
- Learn a topic enough so that you can correct yourself.  
- Remove all disturbances when learning.  
- Practice for at least 20 hours to become good at it.

### 5. What are some of the actions you can take going forward to improve your learning process?  
Based on what Iâ€™ve learned, I can:  
- Use the **Feynman Technique** to explain topics in simple words to check my understanding.  
- Ask questions to experts or peers to compare learning strategies and gain confidence.  
- Switch between **active and diffused modes**: focus deeply at times, but also take breaks to let ideas connect naturally.  
- Remove distractions when studying to stay in deep focus.  
- Break topics into **smaller parts** and practice regularly (aiming for at least 20 hours).
