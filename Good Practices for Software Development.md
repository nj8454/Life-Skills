# Good Practices for Software Development

### Question 1 – Which point(s) were new to you?  
Two ideas stood out as fresh for me.  
* Sharing a quick written summary of requirements right after a meeting—especially when no official tool like Jira is in place—feels like a practical way to avoid misunderstandings and create a single source of truth.  
* Joining meetings a few minutes early and keeping the camera on for rapport was something I’d underestimated; those small gestures clearly build trust and make remote teamwork smoother.

### Question 2 – Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?  
I’d like to get better at giving timely, concise updates when plans shift.  
* **Plan:** Post a short **Today / Blocked / Next** note in the team channel at the end of each day and immediately flag any deadline risk with a revised estimate and the help I need.

I also want to sharpen how I ask for help.  
* **Plan:** Use a clear structure—**context → exact error → what I’ve tried (with logs/screenshots) → minimal reproducible example**—so teammates can assist without a long back-and-forth.
